# Figma Tailwind Plugin

This is an in-progress plugin meant to scaffold Tailwind styles in a Figma project. Currently,
only colors are implemented.

| Colors             | ‚úÖ Done            |

| Config UI          | ‚è∞ Planned         |

| Gradients          | ‚ùì Considering[^1] |
| Blend Modes        | ‚ùì Considering[^2] |

[^1]: Gradients are a complex beast, they're easy to generate but will end up generating a massive
amount of permutations. It's not clear if this is a good idea at this point.

[^2]: I'm unsure if blend modes are useful in the design system at this point.
