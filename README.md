# Figma Tailwind Plugin

This is an in-progress plugin meant to scaffold Tailwind styles in a Figma project. Currently,
only colors are implemented.

| Feature     | Status            |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Colors      | ✅ Done            |
| Box Shadow  | ⏰ Planned         |
| Typography  | ⏰ Planned         |
| Gradients   | ❓ Considering[^1] |
| Blend Modes | ❓ Considering[^2] |

[^1]: Gradients are a complex beast, they're easy to generate but will end up generating a massive amount of permutations. It's not clear if this is a good idea at this point.

[^2]: I'm unsure if blend modes are useful in the design system at this point.
